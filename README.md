## Labs
### Lab 1 - Introduction
Basic tools such as `strace`, `ltrace`, `strings` or `objdump`.
Not included because too easy.


### Lab 2 - Program Analysis
Mainly the analysis of ELF headers, sections an segments.
Only 2 tasks are included because the rest are either stupid or uninteresting.


### Lab 3 - Buffer Overflow
A few scenarios where buffer overflows could be exploited.
Basically IOCLA.


### Lab 4 - Shellcodes I
Tutorials and introductory shellcodes tasks.
Meant to be solved by manually writing shellcodes...
`pnwtools` go brrrrrr.
